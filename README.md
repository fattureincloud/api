# :tada: Welcome to our API repository!

This repository hosts the **Fatture in Cloud Developers Community**!!! The Community is the place where you can interact with the members of Fatture in Cloud team and with other developers like you to solve every doubt about our APIs that could arise. Maybe somebody already answered your question!

You can find our Community in the [**Discussions**](https://github.com/fattureincloud/api/discussions) page.

Our community is organised in the following categories:

## :mega: Announcements

In [this section](https://github.com/fattureincloud/api/discussions/categories/announcements) we announce the most important features we release, so you can always be updated on the most recent changes.

## :bulb: Feature request

Do you have an incredible idea, and you would like to see it implemented into our APIs? As we are always aiming to improve our APIs, it's possible for you to propose new features in this section, just check if the same idea has already been proposed before or it's already on our [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/uAjGCOhL/fic-api-roadmap-overview).

## :wrench: Technical questions

If you can't figure out how to use our APIs you can open a new discussion in the [Q&A section](https://github.com/fattureincloud/api/discussions/categories/q-a), where you can ask questions "Stack Overflow" style, explaining clearly the problems you are facing trying to consume our APIs.

Please, make sure you check out the [guides](https://developers.fattureincloud.it/docs/getting-started) we provide in our documentations that already covers the most common problems you can encounter using our APIs, in particular we suggest that you read the [Invoice Creation guide](https://developers.fattureincloud.it/docs/guides/invoice-creation) that explains in depth all you need to know about the issued documents, the Fatture in Cloud core.
