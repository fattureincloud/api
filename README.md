# :tada:&nbsp Welcome to our API repository!

As you can see this repo is empty, but this doesn't mean that is useless, in fact the main attraction of it it's not the code but the [**Discussions**](https://github.com/fattureincloud/api/discussions)

## :people_hugging:&nbsp Interact with us!

If you have new incredible ideas, you have questions about our APIs or you created a fantastic integration you want to show to the community this is the place for you!

## :mega:&nbsp Announcements

In [this section](https://github.com/fattureincloud/api/discussions/categories/announcements) we write updates about the most important features we release, there you can see if the feature you always wanted is finally available.

## :bulb:&nbsp Feature request

As we are always aiming to improve our APIs, it's possible for you to propose features to be implemented, just make sure the same idea hasn't already been proposed or it's already on our [roadmap](www.url.com).
## :wrech:&nbsp Technical questions

If you can't figure out how to do something with our APIs you can use the [Q&A section](https://github.com/fattureincloud/api/discussions/categories/q-a), where you can ask questions "Stack Overflow" style, explaining clearly the problems you are facing trying to consume our APIs.

Please, make sure you check out the [guides](https://developers-next.fattureincloud.it/docs/intro) we provide in our documentations that already covers the most common problems you can encounter using our APIs, in particular we suggest that you read the [Invoice Creation guide](https://developers-next.fattureincloud.it/docs/guides/invoice-creation) that explains in depth all you need to know about the issued documents, the Fatture in Cloud core.
